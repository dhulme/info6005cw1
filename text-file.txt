1. Set up
---------
Extract src.zip to a directory. Expose the directory to a web server and visit
the directory in the latest version of a major web browser.


2. Data Cleaning
----------------
This section details some of the errors I found in the dataset and how I went
about fixing them. I used two tools for data cleaning: Open Refine (a data
cleaning tool) and Notepad++ (an advanced text editor).

1. Offset data
      A large chunk of the data was offset with many empty cells preceding the
      data. The selection tool from Notepad++ was used to select the empty cells
      and remove them. This was quicker than finding an equivalent tool in
      Open Refine.
      
2. Discrepancies in agency names and investment titles
      Many of the agency names and investment titles representing the same
      category varied slightly. For example 'Department of Agriculture' may have
      been spelt wrong, had white space after the last character, or have the
      prefix 'The'. These errors were fixed using the --- feature in Open Refine.

3. Numerical data errors
(department numbers)

4. Syntax errors in CSV
(commas in agency project ids)

5. Mixed data types
($m in some numbers and wrong date type)


3. Visualisations
-----------------
3.1 Visualisation 1

3.2 Visualisation 2

4. Exceptional Features
-----------------------
Visualisation 1 allows you to see the difference between the planned and actual
spending of different agencies. To allow users to compare which agencies had
the greatest difference I created a third visualisation.
