1. Set up
---------
Extract src.zip to a directory. Expose the directory to a web server and visit
the directory in the latest version of a major web browser.


2. Data Cleaning
----------------
This section details some of the errors I found in the dataset and how I went
about fixing them. I used three tools for data cleaning: Open Refine (a data
cleaning tool), Notepad++ (an advanced text editor) and Microsoft Excel (a
spreadsheet application).

1. Offset data
      A large chunk of the data was offset with many empty cells preceding the
      data. The selection tool from Notepad++ was used to select the empty cells
      and remove them. This was quicker than finding an equivalent tool in
      Open Refine.
      
2. Discrepancies in agency names and investment titles
      Many of the agency names and investment titles representing the same
      category varied slightly. For example 'Department of Agriculture' may have
      been spelt wrong, had white space after the last character, or have the
      prefix 'The'. These errors were fixed using the --- feature in Open Refine.

3. Numerical data errors
      Some cells in the dataset contained errors, for example some of the cells
      in the ''Agency Code'' column. These errors could be corrected safely by
      examining the surrounding data. They were found simply by examining the
      data in Notepad++ and looking for inconsistencies. [maybe I should have done this on googley?]

4. Syntax errors in CSV
      Some rows contained syntax errors that would cause the data to be misread.
      CSV files use commas to separate cells. If a comma is to be used safely in
      the file, that cell should be contained in quotes. Some 'Agency Project 
      ID's contained commas causing an extra cell to be added in those rows.
      These rows were found by looking through the dataset in Excel to find
      those rows with an extra column.
      
5. Mixed data types
      If the data types vary within a column, problems can occur when the data
      is processed. For example, the 'Planned Cost ($ M)' and 'Projected/Actual
      Cost ($ M)' columns contained numerical data, but some of the cells
      contained the text '($m)' which would prevent those cells having numerical
      operations performed on them. These errors were corrected with a regular
      expression in Notepad++. Some cells contained varying data formats, for
      example one cell contained a date formatted at 'DD-MM-YYYY' as supposed to
      all the other cells formatted as 'DD/MM/YYYY'.

3. Visualisations
-----------------
3.1 Visualisation 1

3.2 Visualisation 2

4. Exceptional Features
-----------------------
Visualisation 1 allows you to see the difference between the planned and actual
spending of different agencies. To allow users to compare which agencies had
the greatest difference I created a third visualisation.
