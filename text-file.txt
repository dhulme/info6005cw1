1. Set up
---------
Extract src.zip to a directory. Expose the directory to a web server and visit
the directory in the latest version of a major web browser.

2. Data Cleaning
----------------
This section details some of the errors I found in the dataset and how I went
about fixing them. I used three tools for data cleaning: Open Refine (a data
cleaning tool), Notepad++ (an advanced text editor) and Microsoft Excel (a
spreadsheet application).

1. Offset data
      Error:  A large chunk of the data was offset by several columns leading to
              empty cells
      Fix:    The selection tool from Notepad++ was used to remove the empty
              cells. This was quicker than finding an equivalent tool in 
              Open Refine.
      
2. Discrepancies in agency names and investment titles
      Error:  Many of the agency names and investment titles representing the
              same category varied slightly either through spelling, additional
              white space or a different prefix. 
      Fix:    These errors were fixed using the --- feature in Open Refine.

3. Numerical data errors
      Error:  Some cells contained errors, for example in the ''Agency Code''
              column.
      Fix:    They were found and corrected simply by examining the surrounding 
              data in Notepad++ and looking for inconsistencies.

4. Syntax errors in CSV
      Error:  CSV files use commas to separate cells. If a comma is to be used 
              safely, cells with commas should be contained in quotes. Some 
              'Agency Project ID's contained commas causing an extra cell to be
              added in those rows.
      Fix:    They were found by looking through the dataset in Excel to find
              those rows with an extra column. Once found, the comma was removed
              to bring it in line with the rest of the column.
      
5. Mixed data types
      Error:  If the data types vary within a column, problems can occur when
              the data is processed. For example, the 'Planned Cost ($ M)' and 
              'Projected/Actual Cost ($ M)' columns contained numerical data, 
              but some cells contained the text '($m)' preventing those cells 
              being read as numerical. Some cells contained varying data
              formats, for example one cell contained a date formatted at
              'DD-MM-YYYY' as supposed to all the other cells formatted as 
              'DD/MM/YYYY'.
      Fix:    They were corrected with a regular expressions and manual changes
              in Notepad++. 

3. Visualisations
-----------------
For detailed information regarding the visualisations, please read the
descriptions on the website.

4. Exceptional Features
-----------------------
Visualisation 1 allows you to see the difference between the planned and actual
spending of different agencies. To allow users to compare which agencies had
the greatest difference I created a third visualisation which went above the
coursework specification requesting two.
